Methodology of RP ML model based on R
1. Data input from "application_train.xlsx"
2. Removal of keys (id)
3. Removal of columns with > 80% missing values
?4. PCA on AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU
5. Train Test split
6. Imputation of missing values using mean of each splitted group
7. # Variable selection on key columns (can do PCA reduce further number of features)
8. Define Target variable for training and testing set
9. Use balanced or imbalanced datasets
10. Fit model with training data
11. Predict with testing data
12. Evaluate PPR and FPR using Confusion Rate
13. Create ROC Model

10-subs
a. Logistic Regressor
b. Random Tree
c. XGBoost
d. Neural Network
e. ! SMOTE for imbalanced datasets
